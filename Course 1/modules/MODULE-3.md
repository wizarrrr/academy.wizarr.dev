# Module 3: Directives and Interactivity

## Lesson 3.1: Working with Directives

**Duration**: 1.5 hours

**Objective**: Learn how to use directives in Vue.js for enhancing interactivity.

**Topics**:

1. Introduction to Vue directives
2. Commonly used directives
3. Custom directives

**Activities**:

1. Presentation (30 minutes):

   - Explain the concept of Vue directives.
   - Introduce commonly used directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-on`.

2. Hands-On (45 minutes):

   - Guide students in using these directives in Vue components.
   - Demonstrate how to create custom directives.

3. Q&A and Discussion (30 minutes):
   - Answer any questions related to Vue directives.
   - Discuss scenarios where custom directives can be useful.

**Homework**:

- Create a Vue component that utilizes common directives and implement a custom directive.

## Lesson 3.2: Conditional Rendering

**Duration**: 1.5 hours

**Objective**: Understand conditional rendering in Vue components.

**Topics**:

1. Conditional rendering with `v-if` and `v-else`
2. The `v-show` directive
3. Using `v-if` vs. `v-show`

**Activities**:

1. Presentation (30 minutes):

   - Explain conditional rendering using `v-if`, `v-else`, and `v-show`.
   - Discuss the differences between `v-if` and `v-show`.

2. Hands-On (45 minutes):

   - Guide students in creating Vue components that use conditional rendering effectively.

3. Practice and Comparison (30 minutes):
   - Provide exercises for students to practice using both `v-if` and `v-show`.
   - Compare the two directives in terms of use cases.

**Homework**:

- Create a Vue component that utilizes conditional rendering to display content based on certain conditions.

## Lesson 3.3: Lists and Loops

**Duration**: 1.5 hours

**Objective**: Learn how to work with lists and loops in Vue components.

**Topics**:

1. Iterating over lists with `v-for`
2. List rendering and key management
3. Rendering dynamic lists

**Activities**:

1. Presentation (30 minutes):

   - Explain how to use the `v-for` directive for list rendering.
   - Discuss the importance of keys in list rendering.

2. Hands-On (45 minutes):

   - Guide students in creating Vue components that iterate over lists using `v-for`.
   - Teach key management to avoid rendering issues.

3. Dynamic Lists (30 minutes):
   - Show students how to render dynamic lists based on data.

**Homework**:

- Create a Vue component that uses the `v-for` directive to display a dynamic list of items.

## Assignment: Create an Interactive To-Do List

**Duration**: 2 hours

**Objective**: Apply the knowledge gained from Lessons 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 to build an interactive to-do list using Vue.js.

**Activities**:

1. Assignment Brief (15 minutes):

   - Provide a brief description of the assignment: Create an interactive to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

2. Work on Assignment (1.5 hours):

   - Students work on building the interactive to-do list.

3. Presentation and Review (30 minutes):
   - Students present their to-do list components to the class and receive feedback.

**Assessment**:

- Assessment of the completed interactive to-do list assignment.

By the end of Module 3, students should be proficient in working with Vue directives, conditional rendering, and list rendering. They will also have practical experience in creating interactive and dynamic Vue components, such as an interactive to-do list.
